####WEATHER FORECAST APP####
A WEATHER FORECAST APPLICATION IS CREATED USING REACT
--  The user can search for the weather in a specific city by typing in the city name and clicking the submit button. The weather data is obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API.
-- The component displays the weather forecast for the next five days, with a card for each day. Each card shows the day of the week, the date, a weather icon, the temperature, and a brief description of the weather.
-- It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data showing the high and low temperatures daily and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. 
-- The user can click on a day to see its hourly forecast, which will be displayed in a separate view. 
-- The application also uses React Router to create routes for the 5-day forecast and each day's hourly forecast.
